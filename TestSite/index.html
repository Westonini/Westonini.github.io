                <h2 class='underline'>About Me</h2>
                <p>I, Weston Elliott (a.k.a. Westonini) am a 20-year-old Computer Science student with a technical skill-set that includes programming, game development, computer knowledge, as well as some Photoshop experience. As of writing this up I am currently a sophmore going on to be a junior in the upcoming semester. As you'll see down below and at my itch.io page, I've already made a few game projects both in groups and solo. There are also some projects that are unlisted either because they're unfinished or I'm not satisfied with its quality. Currently all of the games that I've created have been made in the Unity Engine, but I'm planning on learning other engines as well, namely Unreal Engine. I'm familiar with at least the basics of several programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, and C++. Of course I also had to learn some basic HTML and CSS to create this website, but as you can see I'm still not exactly very experienced when it comes to things like web design and the like just yet. I'm also an officer for the Video Game Development Association (VGDA) which is a club in CSULB which, as the name implies, is dedicated to helping teach aspiring game developers the ropes of game dev to help them create projects of their own!</p>
                <p>For a while I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do after High School. I was a diligent student who just went to school, came home, did their homework, and played video games. However, I noticed that at a very young age I had a knack for computers and creation. There was a game I used to play as a child called Blockland which was a bit similar to Roblox in which it allowed people to build and display their wildest dreams all within its own little game. What really hooked me in the game was their approach to scripting, which I had no idea at the time was something similar to programming. It was a very bare-bones simplified version of coding in which all the logic and statements were already there, it just had to be put together to make something happen. Looking back on it now, I realize that games like that may be the reason why I've found my passion for programming, specifically game dev programming, and is why I've decided to pursue it as either a hobby or career. I say "or" because I'd like for it to become my job, but the game dev industry seems to be a difficult job to actually get into. So for now, I just create games in my free time to help advance my programming skills and to bring my ideas to life. </p>
