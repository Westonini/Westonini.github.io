                <h2 class='underline'>About Me</h2>
                <p>I, Weston Elliott (a.k.a. Westonini) am a 20-year-old Computer Science student with a technical skill-set that includes programming, game development, computer knowledge, as well as some Photoshop experience. As of writing this up I am currently a sophmore going on to be a junior in the upcoming semester. As you'll see down below and at my itch.io page, I've already made a few game projects both in groups and solo. There are also some projects that are unlisted either because they're unfinished or I'm not satisfied with its quality. Currently all of the games that I've created have been made in the Unity Engine, but I'm planning on learning other engines as well, namely Unreal Engine. I'm familiar with at least the basics of several programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, and C++. Of course I also had to learn some basic HTML and CSS to create this website, but as you can see I'm still not exactly very experienced when it comes to things like web design and the like just yet. I'm also an officer for the Video Game Development Association (VGDA) which is a club in CSULB that, as the name implies, is dedicated to teaching aspiring game developers the ropes of game dev to help them create projects of their own.</p>
                <p>For a while I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do after High School. I considered myself to be a diligent student who just went to school, came home, did their homework, and played video games every single day. However, when it came time for me to figure out what I wanted to do with my life I realized that what I wanted was already in front of me. For better or for worse I'm practically always staring into my computer screen doing who knows what, so it only made sense that I pursue some sort of profession that was computer or at least technology-based. Thinking about it some more I started to wonder if it was possible for someone like to me to make some sort of video game like the many that I've admired over the years. I then realized that I'd always been fond of games that allowed me to make things happen as a result of my tinkerings with its aspects. There was this one game similar to Roblox which I played as a kid called Blockland which had a very bare-bones scripting type of element to it which allowed you to go through various premade arguments and mash them together to make something happen. I didn't even know what the concept of scripting was back then, but I would spend hours setting up overly convoluted scripts just to formulate my own little world and create all sorts of minigames for myself and others to enjoy. I believe that this game and many others are proof to myself that video game programming is something that would interest me, and this was further proved after creating some games of my own within the Unity Engine and just to find out that I really was enjoying the process. I know that the video game development industry can be quite tough to actually get into, but one day I'm hoping to get myself involved in it and help program games that others will admire like the many that I have before. <span id='startOfGames'></span>But im the meantime I plan to continue to create games in my free time to help advance my programming skills and to bring some of my weird ideas to life.</p>
